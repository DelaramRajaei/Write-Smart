## Babel
The Babel library is a powerful tool for multilingual typesetting in LaTeX, enabling users to incorporate multiple languages and writing systems into their documents easily. With Babel, you can seamlessly switch between different languages, making it a valuable resource for creating documents with diverse linguistic requirements.

 The primary reference for Babel includes its source code and an accompanying PDF manual.
